# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first, in the format of
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Until 1.0, breaking changes come without a major bump and are recorded here.
From 1.0, the public API of the shipped modules is stable and a break waits for
a major release; the `.api` dump beside each module is what that promise is
checked against, on every build.

A version is cut by tagging — `git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags`. The build
reads the nearest `v` tag, so an untagged commit is a `-SNAPSHOT` of the next
one.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet. The repository carries its process, its build and its gates; the
first spec is where the work starts.
